Warning: this extension is not ready yet. It was written during Microsoft One Week's hack-a-thon.

The goal of this extension is to allow tree-like navigation in Visual Studio. It helps blind programmers to quickly skim through the code. Pressing arrow keys can make you skip method bodies or any scoped block. Your cursor will always remain at the same scope level. Imagine the code as a tree of elements and scope variations being link between nodes.
